the event flow is pointerdown (on the sprite itself), gameobjectdown (from the input plugin) and then pointerdown (from the input plugin)
the event is sent to all 3 handlers
if you stop it at any one, it gets no further
sprite.on('pointerdown', (pointer, x, y, event) => { event.stopPropagation(); }) = the other 2 handlers never get fired
this.input.on('gameobjectdown', (pointer, gameobjects, event) => { // do stuff and then event.stopPropagation(); }) = it never gets sent to this.input.on('pointerdown')
