Fixes.
1. Gameover screen - remember to color signs appropriately
6. Create a Close Menu button
7. Add color schemes
8. Make the whole thing centered when the full board is on. Right now it is skewed towards the top
9. since I now have block.block_value, see if I can simplify code
10. RestoreBlocks has "value_id" as input, but really, it seems simply value. Re-check.
