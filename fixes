Fixes.

1. since I now have block.block_value, see if I can simplify code
2. RestoreBlocks has "value_id" as input, but really, it seems simply value. Re-check.
3. If there is no replay - the app will just fail. Need a workaround, or rather a check that there is a replay. If not, somehow make that clear.
4. Create a mechanism which will save the replay and maybe retry re-uploading it when Internet comes back. But this is a power feature, definitely not essential.
5. Add the ability to play Yesterday's board.
6. Make the reset sound louder. And maybe make the Undo sound quieter.
7. Add a border around a Daily or Weekly if someone beat your record, or if you still haven't played the board
8. Add the ability to play Yesterday's board, and add a replay link to all non-periodicals.
