Fixes.
1. Gameover screen - remember to color signs appropriately
6. Create a Close Menu button
7. Add color schemes
8. Make the whole thing centered when the full board is on. Right now it is skewed towards the top
9. since I now have block.block_value, see if I can simplify code
10. RestoreBlocks has "value_id" as input, but really, it seems simply value. Re-check.
11. Make replay buttons more spread.
12. Weekly board replay featured a -2 Total Blocks in the very end, as if a separate move
13. Currently due to the fact that the board seed is the primary key, there cannot be both q and f boards with the same board seed. Maybe this is ok.
14. In the script generating periodicals there is no workaround in case of a board_seed collussion. If the newly generated board seed already exists, it will simply not get added.
15. Add the loader and error xhttp stuff, so that if there is no Internet, it just reloads the board.
16. If there is no replay - the app will just fail. Need a workaround, or rather a check that there is a replay. If not, somehow make that clear.
17. Rules.
18. Create a mechanism which will save the replay and maybe retry re-uploading it when Internet comes back. But this is a power feature, definitely not essential.
