Fixes.

1. Add color schemes
3. since I now have block.block_value, see if I can simplify code
4. RestoreBlocks has "value_id" as input, but really, it seems simply value. Re-check.
6. If there is no replay - the app will just fail. Need a workaround, or rather a check that there is a replay. If not, somehow make that clear.
8. Create a mechanism which will save the replay and maybe retry re-uploading it when Internet comes back. But this is a power feature, definitely not essential.
9. Add the ability to play Yesterday's board.
